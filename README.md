- 👋 Hi, I’m Ratul Das! I'm currently a physics undergrad at NISER Bhubaneswar
- 👀 I’m interested in geophysics, nonlinear dynamics, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and solar physics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about phase transitions, magnetism, superconductivity, probability theory, and machine learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on problems in geophysics and nonlinear dynamics, both in theory and experiment
- 📫 You can contact me through my institute email address (ratul.das@niser.ac.in) or through Discord (pythag0rad#9037)
